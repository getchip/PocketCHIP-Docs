#Using Accessories
Just because **PocketC.H.I.P.** is complete with a keyboard and screen doesn't mean you can't add speakers, storage, or wireless gadgets to make it even more fun. 

**PocketC.H.I.P. input and output ports are all handled by C.H.I.P.**. Chances are good that if an accessory works with C.H.I.P., it will work with PocketC.H.I.P.. !

## Audio

**PocketC.H.I.P.** does not have a built-in speaker, but that doesn't mean it can't output sound.

To listen to audio from PocketC.H.I.P., **attach any wired headphones or speakers to the audio jack** at the top of the device. This jack is known as a TRRS jack and can accommodate headphones with built-in microphones. 

## Micro-USB

Use the **micro-USB** port for charging PocketC.H.I.P. with a 5-volt, 1-amp power supply. Most cell phone chargers that use a USB-micro cable will work with PocketC.H.I.P.

## Standard USB

Use the **standard USB** port for attaching USB accessories, like a **keyboard**, **mouse**, **MIDI controller**, **sound card**, **hard drive**, or **more**. 

USB devices take power to operate. If they are not independently powered, they will reduce the battery life of PocketC.H.I.P. or cause operation to become sporadic.
