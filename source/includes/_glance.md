## Touchscreen

![touchscreen](images/finger-on-screen.jpg)

**PocketC.H.I.P.** features a **4.3" display** made up of **480 x 272 pixels**. The display is **resistive touch** and responds to tapping and sliding. That means you can use a finger or almost any object that isn't sharp -- you don't want to scratch your screen.

**Tap once** to open apps, press buttons, and close windows.

**Press and slide** to scroll, adjust sliders, and resize windows.

## Keyboard

**PocketC.H.I.P.** has a full **QWERTY keyboard** with comfortably located arrow keys for gaming. 

Each button is labeled with **pink text**, which identifies the default button behavior. Some buttons have two rows of pink text stacked atop each other. The bottom text is the primary behavior of the key. The top text identifies the button's secondary behavior, which is accessible by holding down **SHIFT** and pressing the button. 

For example: **Holding SHIFT** and **pressing 1** types **!** 

Some buttons are labeled to the top, left with **white text on a pink background**. These keys are mostly located on the right side of PocketC.H.I.P.'s keyboard and are for characters like function keys (**F1**, **F2**, ... **F11**) and lesser used punctuation marks (**{}<>|;**). To type these specialized characters, **hold the FN key** and press the desired button.

## Removable enclosure

**PocketC.H.I.P.** is extremely hackable and we encourage you to modify the hardware. It is **easy to take apart**, since there are no screws used in the assembly. 

If you want to fully disassemble PocketC.H.I.P., first (carefully) **remove C.H.I.P.** from the back of PocketC.H.I.P.. Then flip PocketC.H.I.P. around and **remove the frame** (technically known as a bezel) around the perimeter of the screen. **Remove the back case** of PocketC.H.I.P. by pressing the tabs above the screen and on either side of the Home/Power button.

While the case is open, check out the **“secret” prototyping area** and **GPIO solder pads** inside the enclosure!

Along the top edge of PocketC.H.I.P. are input and output pins from C.H.I.P.. These are great for attaching and controlling sensors, motors, and LEDs. 

See the C.H.I.P. documentation to learn how to use them [here](http://docs.getchip.com/#gpio).

## Pencil stand

Give your hands a break! You can **prop PocketC.H.I.P. up on a table with a pencil or pen**. Pencils go in the right-hand-side pencil hole, and pens in the left hole. You only need one.
