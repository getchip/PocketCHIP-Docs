Your PocketC.H.I.P. uses a **3.7-volt LiPo battery**, that should last for about **five hours** of use. Increase battery life by dimming the screen brightness and turning off WiFi. 

The top left corner of the screen shows your battery level, and PocketC.H.I.P. will warn you when the battery charge is getting too low for operation.

**Plug PocketC.H.I.P. into a 5-volt 1A power supply with a USB-micro cable to charge the 3.7V battery.**

Because it's C.H.I.P.'s on-board circuitry that manages the charging of PocketC.H.I.P.'s battery, the C.H.I.P. must remain attached to PocketC.H.I.P. for battery charging.

PocketC.H.I.P. is compatible with with most cell phone chargers that use a USB-micro cable.

### Sleep

Sleep is a low-power state that saves battery, and also saves you time, since it's faster for PocketC.H.I.P. to wake from sleep than to boot from a powered-off state.

To enter sleep mode, **press the power icon** in the bottom left corner of the home screen and **select “sleep.”** from the menu. 

PocketC.H.I.P. is designed to turn off the screen and backlight after a few minutes without any user interaction. 

To wake from either sleep state, simply touch the screen.

### Shutdown

Shutdown PocketC.H.I.P. by pressing the **power icon** in the bottom left corner of the home screen and **tapping “shutdown.”** 

If for some reason, PocketC.H.I.P. becomes unresponsive, you can also shut down PocketC.H.I.P. by **holding down the HOME/Power button for eight (8) seconds**. This cuts battery power to PocketC.H.I.P. and shuts it off. Only use this method if all other methods do not work.
