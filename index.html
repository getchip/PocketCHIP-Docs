<p><img alt="PocketC.H.I.P. Front" src="images/front-and-back.png" /></p>

<p>Hey! Thanks for checking out <strong>PocketC.H.I.P.</strong>!</p>

<p><strong>PocketC.H.I.P.</strong> is a game console, a portable synthesizer, and a Linux field terminal. With a bit of effort, it can become a whole lot more – see PockulusC.H.I.P., PocketC.H.I.P. as a VR headset <a href="http://pockulus.getchip.com/">here</a>. </p>

<p>The point is, <strong>PocketC.H.I.P. can be what you want it to be</strong> and we&rsquo;re excited to see what you will do with your PocketC.H.I.P..</p>

<p>These are the <strong>Docs</strong>, which are intended to help you get started with PocketC.H.I.P.. The Docs will introduce you to the software that comes pre-installed on PocketC.H.I.P., explain how to use the system, and hopefully plant some ideas about how you can do even more with your PocketC.H.I.P..</p>

<p>The Docs will <em>not</em> teach you how to code (though it will give tips), how to program a game (though it will explain the tools), how to make music (though it will describe options), or how to build onto PocketC.H.I.P. (though it will encourage it).</p>

<p><strong>Have fun!</strong></p>

<h1 id="quick-start">Quick Start</h1>

<p>This section explains how to <strong>turn on PocketC.H.I.P.</strong>, <strong>setup WiFi</strong>, and <strong>charge your device</strong>. </p>

<p><img alt="Step 1" src="images/image_1.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Turn on PocketC.H.I.P.</strong> by pressing down the <strong>Home/Power button</strong> at the bottom, middle of the keyboard, for about <strong>two seconds</strong>. </p>

<p><img alt="Step 2" src="images/image_2.png" /></p>

<p><strong>PocketC.H.I.P.</strong> will take a moment to fully load, but while it does you will see the C.H.I.P. logo and then a PocketC.H.I.P. splash screen. </p>

<p>Once PocketC.H.I.P. is ready you will see a series of slides showing the PocketC.H.I.P. basics. Use the <strong>right arrow key</strong> or <strong>tap the right side of the screen</strong> to advance forward in the slideshow.</p>

<p>Once you have clicked through the basics, you will see a screen with six icons. This is the <strong>Home Screen</strong>.</p>

<p><img alt="Annotated HOME screen" src="images/home.jpg" /></p>

<p>Use a <strong>finger</strong> or <strong>stylus</strong> (or really anything that&rsquo;s solid and isn&rsquo;t sharp) to tap on the application you want to use. Press gently enough to make contact with the screen. There&rsquo;s no need to apply a lot of force. A gentle touch will do.</p>

<p>While using an application, <strong>press the Home/Power button to return to the Home Screen</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="wifi-setup">WiFi Setup</h3>

<p><img alt="Settings icon" src="images/no_scale/settings-icon.jpg" /></p>

<p>From the Home Screen, tap the <strong>settings icon</strong> in the bottom right corner to access the Settings Screen. </p>

<p>Press the button to the right of the WiFi switch to open a menu of all the networks in range. Scroll through the list and select your network by pressing the arrows above and below the network names. To refresh the network list, just exit the list and enter again. </p>

<p>When prompted, enter the network password in the text field, then touch the <strong>[Connect]</strong> button. It may take a few seconds to connect.</p>

<h3 id="charging">Charging</h3>

<p><img alt="image of PocketC.H.I.P. with cable plugged in" src="images/wall-power.jpg" /></p>

<p><strong>Plug in PocketC.H.I.P.</strong> to a <strong>5-volt 1A power</strong> supply with a USB-micro cable to charge the <strong>3.7V battery</strong>.</p>

<p>Because it is C.H.I.P.&rsquo;s on-board circuitry that manages the charging of PocketC.H.I.P.&rsquo;s battery, the <strong>C.H.I.P. must remain attached to PocketC.H.I.P. for battery charging</strong>.</p>

<p>PocketC.H.I.P. is <strong>compatible with most cell phone chargers</strong> that use a USB-micro cable.</p>

<h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3>

<p>If PocketC.H.I.P. becomes unresponsive, <strong>hold down the Home/Power button for eight seconds</strong>. This will cut power to PocketC.H.I.P., and immediately shut it down. Only use this shutdown method if no other shutdown methods work.</p>

          <h1 id="pocketc-h-i-p-at-a-glance">PocketC.H.I.P. at a Glance</h1>

<p><img alt="PocketC.H.I.P. front and back" src="images/front-and-back.png" /></p>

<h2 id="touchscreen">Touchscreen</h2>

<p><img alt="touchscreen" src="images/finger-on-screen.jpg" /></p>

<p><strong>PocketC.H.I.P.</strong> features a <strong>4.3&quot; display</strong> made up of <strong>480 x 272 pixels</strong>. The display is <strong>resistive touch</strong> and responds to <strong>tapping</strong> and <strong>sliding</strong>. This means you can use a finger or almost any object that isn&rsquo;t sharp &ndash; you don&rsquo;t want to scratch your screen.</p>

<p><strong>Tap once</strong> to open apps, press buttons, and close windows.</p>

<p><strong>Press and slide</strong> to scroll, adjust sliders, and resize windows.</p>

<h2 id="keyboard">Keyboard</h2>

<p><img alt="Keyboard layout" src="images/keyboard.jpg" /></p>

<p><strong>PocketC.H.I.P.</strong> has a full <strong>QWERTY keyboard</strong> with comfortably located arrow keys for gaming. </p>

<p>Each button is labeled with <strong>pink text</strong>, which identifies the default button behavior. Some buttons have two rows of pink text stacked atop each other. The bottom text is the primary behavior of the key. The top text identifies the button&rsquo;s secondary behavior, which is accessible by holding down <strong>SHIFT</strong> and pressing the button. </p>

<p>For example: <strong>Holding SHIFT</strong> and <strong>pressing 1</strong> types <strong>!</strong> </p>

<p>Some buttons are labeled to the top, left with <strong>white text on a pink background</strong>. These keys are mostly located on the right side of PocketC.H.I.P.&rsquo;s keyboard and are for characters like function keys (<strong>F1</strong>, <strong>F2</strong>, &hellip; <strong>F11</strong>) and lesser used punctuation marks (<strong>{}&lt;&gt;|;</strong>). To type these specialized characters, <strong>hold the FN key</strong> and press the desired button.</p>

<p><img alt="Function keys" src="images/function-keys.jpg" /></p>

<p>For example: <strong>Holding FN</strong> and <strong>pressing J</strong> types <strong>&gt;</strong></p>

<h2 id="removable-enclosure">Removable enclosure</h2>

<p><img alt="Exploded View" src="images/exploded.jpg" /></p>

<p><strong>PocketC.H.I.P.</strong> is extremely hackable and we encourage you to modify the hardware. It is <strong>easy to take apart</strong>, since there are no screws used in the assembly. </p>

<p><img alt="Bezel" src="images/bezel.jpg" /></p>

<p>If you want to fully disassemble PocketC.H.I.P., first (carefully) <strong>remove C.H.I.P.</strong> from the back of PocketC.H.I.P.. Then flip PocketC.H.I.P. around and <strong>remove the frame</strong> (technically known as a bezel) around the perimeter of the screen. <strong>Remove the back case</strong> of PocketC.H.I.P. by pressing the tabs above the screen and on either side of the Home/Power button.</p>

<p>While the case is open, check out the <strong>“secret” prototyping area</strong> and <strong>GPIO solder pads</strong> inside the enclosure!</p>

<p><img alt="Open PocketC.H.I.P. to reveal a secret prototyping area" src="images/secret.jpg" /></p>

<h2 id="gpio-access">GPIO Access</h2>

<p><img alt="GPIO" src="images/gpio.jpg" /></p>

<p>Along the top edge of PocketC.H.I.P. are input and output pins from C.H.I.P.. These are great for attaching and controlling sensors, motors, and LEDs. </p>

<p>See the C.H.I.P. documentation to learn how to use them <a href="http://docs.getchip.com/#gpio">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pencil-stand">Pencil stand</h2>

<p><img alt="Stand it up with a pencil" src="images/stand.jpg" /></p>

<p>Give your hands a break! You can <strong>prop PocketC.H.I.P. up on a table with a pencil or pen</strong>. Pencils go in the right-hand-side pencil hole, and pens in the left hole. You only need one.</p>

          <h1 id="power-and-charging">Power and Charging</h1>

<h2 id="battery-life">Battery Life</h2>

<p><img alt="Check out that battery" src="images/back.jpg" /></p>

<p>Your PocketC.H.I.P. uses a <strong>3.7-volt LiPo battery</strong>, that should last for about <strong>five hours</strong> of use. Increase battery life by dimming the screen brightness and turning off WiFi. </p>

<p>The top left corner of the screen shows your battery level, and PocketC.H.I.P. will warn you when the battery charge is getting too low for operation.</p>

<h2 id="charge-pocketc-h-i-p">Charge PocketC.H.I.P.</h2>

<p><img alt="Charging PocketC.H.I.P. " src="images/wall-power.jpg" /></p>

<p><strong>Plug PocketC.H.I.P. into a 5-volt 1A power supply with a USB-micro cable to charge the 3.7V battery.</strong></p>

<p>Because it&rsquo;s C.H.I.P.&rsquo;s on-board circuitry that manages the charging of PocketC.H.I.P.&rsquo;s battery, the C.H.I.P. must remain attached to PocketC.H.I.P. for battery charging.</p>

<p>PocketC.H.I.P. is compatible with with most cell phone chargers that use a USB-micro cable.</p>

<h2 id="sleep-and-shutdown">Sleep and Shutdown</h2>

<p><img alt="Power icon" src="images/no_scale/power-icon.jpg" /></p>

<h3 id="sleep">Sleep</h3>

<p><strong>Sleep</strong> is a low-power state that saves battery, and also saves you time, since it&rsquo;s faster for PocketC.H.I.P. to wake from sleep than to boot from a powered-off state.</p>

<p>To enter sleep mode, <strong>tap the power icon</strong> in the bottom left corner of the home screen and <strong>select “Sleep.”</strong> from the menu. </p>

<p>PocketC.H.I.P. is designed to turn off the screen and backlight after a few minutes without any user interaction. </p>

<p>To wake from either sleep state, simply touch the screen or press a key.</p>

<p><img alt="Power menu" src="images/power-menu.jpg" /></p>

<h3 id="shutdown">Shutdown</h3>

<p>Shutdown PocketC.H.I.P. by pressing the <strong>power icon</strong> in the bottom left corner of the home screen and <strong>tapping “shutdown.”</strong> </p>

<p>If for some reason, PocketC.H.I.P. becomes unresponsive, you can also shut down PocketC.H.I.P. by <strong>holding down the HOME/Power button for eight seconds</strong>. This cuts battery power to PocketC.H.I.P. and shuts it off. Only use this method if all other methods do not work.</p>

          <h1 id="using-pocketc-h-i-p">Using PocketC.H.I.P.</h1>

</ul>

<p>The code editor is not the only editor in PICO-8. Access the other editors by tapping on the icons in the upper right-hand corner of the editor. </p>

<h3 id="sprite-editor">Sprite Editor</h3>

<p><img alt="Draw custom graphics" src="images/pico-sprites.jpg" /></p>

<p>Use the sprite editor to create the artwork that make up tiles, characters, or other graphical elements of the game. The navigator at the bottom of the sprite editor screen shows an 8x8 pixel box that is displayed in the sprite sheet window, but it is possible to use freeform tools (pan, select) to edit larger areas. </p>

<p>Use the following tools to edit sprites:</p>

<h4 id="draw-tool">Draw Tool</h4>

<ul>
<li>Click on the desired color and then click in the editor window to apply the color to each pixel.</li>
<li>Hold the <strong>CTRL</strong> button and click on a pixel to replace all of the same-colored pixels in the window with the selected color.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="stamp-tool">Stamp Tool</h4>

<ul>
<li>Select an area of the sprite sheet that you want to copy using the select tool.</li>
<li>Select the stamp tool and click the location where you want the copied pixels to be pasted.</li>
<li>Hold <strong>CTRL</strong> to stamp with transparency (this pastes all of the non-black pixels in the selection).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="select-tool">Select Tool</h4>

<ul>
<li>Use the shortcut: <strong>SHIFT</strong> or <strong>S</strong> to save time.</li>
<li>Click and drag with the select tool to highlight an area of the sprite sheet.</li>
<li>Enter or click to select none.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="pan-tool">Pan Tool</h4>

<ul>
<li>Use the shortcut: <strong>Spacebar</strong>.</li>
<li>Click and drag to move around the sprite sheet.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="fill-tool">Fill Tool</h4>

<ul>
<li>Fill an area with the selected color.</li>
<li>If you have selected an area of the sprite sheet, the fill will be limited to the selected area.</li>
<li>If no selection is active, the fill will be limited to the area in the editor window.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="map-editor">Map Editor</h3>

<p><img alt="Create your own levels" src="images/map.jpg" /></p>

<p>The tools for the map editor work similarly to those in the sprite editor. However, rather than choosing colors and drawing directly on the map sheet, select a sprite and use the draw or fill tool to place sprites into the map sheet. </p>

<h3 id="sound-effects-editor">Sound Effects Editor</h3>

<p><img alt="Customize sound effects" src="images/pico-soundfx.jpg" /></p>

<p>PICO-8&rsquo;s sound editor has two view modes: <strong>graph view</strong> and <strong>tracker view</strong>. Switch between modes by tapping on the graph and tracker buttons in the upper-left corner of the sound editor.</p>

<p>In both views, the number in the top left, under the view selector is the sound effect number. PICO-8 can handle <strong>64 different effects</strong>. </p>

<p><strong>Change the speed of the sound</strong> by clicking on the number in the box labelled <strong>SPD</strong>. Tap and drag to change the value (dragging left decreases, dragging right increases). The <strong>SPD value describes the duration of each note</strong>, so the higher the value, the slower the sound will play.</p>

<p>The <strong>LOOP values</strong> define the start and end points of a section of the sound effect that repeats. These can be changed by tapping and dragging like the SPD values.</p>

<p>Select from the <strong>eight available instruments</strong> by clicking on the gray waveform boxes below the SPD and LOOP fields. </p>

<p>Press the <strong>spacebar to play/stop</strong> the current sound effect.</p>

<h3 id="graph-mode">Graph mode</h3>

<p>In <strong>graph mode</strong>, <strong>choose an instrument</strong> and then click-and-drag left-to-right to <em>draw</em> the sound across the pitch window. Draw higher in the window to create a sound with a higher pitch. Adjust the volume of each note, with the sliders in the volume window at the bottom of the graph mode screen.</p>

<h3 id="tracker-mode">Tracker mode</h3>

<p>In the <strong>tracker mode</strong>, each line of <strong>six dots represents a note</strong>. Each dot represents an aspect of the notes. In left-to-right order they are: frequency, octave, instrument, volume, and effect.</p>

<h4 id="frequency">Frequency</h4>

<ul>
<li>Denoted by the letter of the musical pitch. </li>
<li>Input the pitches, using the <strong>q2w3er5t6y7ui</strong> keys like a piano.</li>
<li><strong>Q</strong> is a <em>C</em> note, <strong>W</strong> is a <em>D</em> note.</li>
<li>The number keys are the <strong>sharps</strong> and <strong>flats</strong> (like the black keys on a piano).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="octave">Octave</h4>

<p>For each note, <strong>choose octave 1</strong>, <strong>2</strong>, <strong>3</strong>, or <strong>4</strong> in the <strong>OCT field</strong> at the top, or type the corresponding number: <strong>1 is the lowest octave</strong> and <strong>4 is the highest</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="instrument">Instrument</h4>

<p>Choose one of the instruments in the gray waveform boxes or type the corresponding number (0 through 7).</p>

<h4 id="volume">Volume</h4>

<p>Choose volume level in the VOL field or type the corresponding number (0 through 7).</p>

<h4 id="effect">Effect</h4>

<p>Choose an effect from the boxes under the instruments or type the corresponding number (0 through 7).
The 8 effects are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>0</strong> - none </li>
<li><strong>1</strong> - slide </li>
<li><strong>2</strong> - vibrato </li>
<li><strong>3</strong> - drop </li>
<li><strong>4</strong> - fade in </li>
<li><strong>5</strong> - fade out </li>
<li><strong>6</strong> - fast arpeggio </li>
<li><strong>7</strong> - slow arpeggio</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="music-editor">Music Editor</h3>

<p><img alt="Compose your soundtrack" src="images/pico-music.jpg" /></p>

<p>The <strong>music editor</strong> allows <strong>up to four effects at a time</strong> for your game&rsquo;s soundtrack. Click on the boxes above each column to activate the track and choose which effects will be included in each song pattern.</p>

<p><strong>Patterns</strong> can be set to move to the next pattern, repeat the current pattern, or stop when finished with the arrow and stop icons on the upper right. </p>

<p><strong>PICO-8</strong> can hold up to <strong>64 song patterns</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="sunvox">SunVox</h2>

<p>The <strong>SunVox tracker</strong> is a fully featured music production studio. It&rsquo;s lightweight, sounds great, and is designed to work with a stylus on a single, small screen. As a result, it&rsquo;s a perfect fit for for making music and playing with sound on PocketC.H.I.P.. </p>

<p>To get started launch <strong>SunVox</strong>, put on some headphones, press <strong>F9</strong> (remember, you&rsquo;ll need to <strong>hold the FN key</strong> and <strong>press 9</strong> to get <strong>F9</strong>) to start playback, and dive into a complete world of electronic sound.</p>

<h3 id="interface-overview">Interface Overview</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick overview of what you see when you launch <strong>SunVox</strong>, and what the different parts of the interface do. Visit <a href="http://www.warmplace.ru/wiki/sunvox:manual_en">the SunVox page</a> for more information, including complete keyboard mappings. You may also find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJh6yiKPqE4">this SunVox video</a> helpful.</p>

<p><img alt="SunVox screen areas notated" src="images/sunvox_editpattern_callout.jpg" /></p>

<h3 id="pattern-editor">Pattern Editor</h3>

<p><img alt="SunVox pattern editor" src="images/sunvox_editpattern.jpg" /></p>

<p>The <strong>Pattern Editor</strong> is <strong>like a page of sheet music</strong>. Instead of staffs, measures, clefs, notes, and articulations, it has 32 rows and several columns that represent pitch, timing, and even how a pitch is played (soft, hard, bright, <em>etc</em>).</p>

<p><strong>Patterns represent chunks of a song</strong> that will later be dropped into the timeline of the song and arranged with other patterns. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> All the numbers are in <strong>hexadecimal</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">see hexadecimal</a>) so instead of the number <em>46</em>,  you&rsquo;ll see <em>2E</em>. These notes can play drums, lead instruments that sound like a guitar (maybe), bass notes, or even atonal washes of sound. </p>

<p>In the <strong>pattern editor</strong> you can <strong>add notes and note modifiers to compose patterns</strong>. </p>

<p><strong>Spacebar</strong> toggles edit mode on and off, use the <strong>arrow keys</strong> to select rows, use <strong>letters</strong> to enter notes, use <strong>numbers</strong> to enter (hexadecimal) values for velocity, module, and control values.</p>

<h3 id="touch-keyboard">Touch Keyboard</h3>

<p>The <strong>Touch Keyboard</strong> is in the middle of the screen. Tap on it and you&rsquo;ll hear sound.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re editing a <strong>Pattern</strong>, you can use this to enter notes. Just tap in the first column in the editor where you want a note to play and then tap the note on the touch keyboard. The editor will record the note you play and then move to the next line so you can tap the next note you want to play. </p>

<p>You can also use <strong>PocketC.H.I.P.&rsquo;s QWERTY keyboard</strong> to enter notes. To enter notes on the QWERTY keyboard, use it similar to a piano. For example, <strong>Z is a c note</strong> and <strong>X is a d note</strong>.</p>

<p>From left to right across the bottom row of the keyboard, the notes ascend. </p>

<p>For <strong>sharp</strong> and <strong>flat</strong> notes, use the row above. For example, <strong>S</strong> is a c-sharp because it is above and between the <strong>Z</strong> and <strong>X</strong> keys (similar to where the c-sharp key is on a piano, above and between the c and d notes). </p>

<h3 id="modules-synths-and-effects">Modules (synths and effects)</h3>

<p><img alt="SunVox modules" src="images/sunvox_modules.jpg" /></p>

<p>The <strong>Module Editor</strong> is located below the <strong>Touch Keyboard</strong> on its right. This includes the <strong>different instruments</strong>, <strong>synthesizers</strong>, or <strong>effects</strong> you can use to change the sounds that you put into the patterns above. You can add new modules, delete current modules or rearrange modules to fit your needs. </p>

<p>With any sounds you make, you need something to generate the sound first. Double-tap on the background in the <strong>module editor</strong> and then choose a <strong>generator</strong> from the list. Once you&rsquo;ve picked a generator need to <strong>connect it to the output</strong>. Do this by <strong>holding SHIFT</strong> and then tapping and dragging from the generator to the OUT box </p>

<p>You can also add <strong>effects</strong> to the sounds made by the generator. Double-tap in the background again and choose an effect from the list. Now change the route the sound goes through by tapping and dragging from the generator to the effect. Then tap-and-drag from the effect to the output box. </p>

<p>You can have <strong>multiple instruments</strong> and <strong>different paths</strong> for the sound in the editor at one time. When editing patterns, tap on the generator you want to use and then edit the pattern. Changes to the pattern will be made using the currently selected generator.</p>

<p><strong>To delete an effect or generator</strong>, double-tap the module and tap the delete button.</p>

<h3 id="parameter-controls">Parameter Controls</h3>

<p><strong>Parameter Controls</strong> for the currently selected module are in the bottom left corner of the interface. Violin players can bend a string and change how they bow, vocalists can shape their mouths and vocal chords, electric guitarists can stomp on pedals and hit the whammy bar, synthesizer nerds can turn knobs and sliders. In SunVox, you can modify how a synth or effect sounds using the horizontal sliders in the Parameter Controls. </p>

<p>Tap on a module and use the Parameter Controls on the left to modify the sound. Play the (piano or PocketC.H.I.P.) keyboard to hear the sound of a synth module. Use <strong>CTRL-arrows</strong> to jump to different modules. <strong>SHIFT-drag</strong> to connect and disconnect modules. </p>

<h4 id="resize-handles">Resize Handles</h4>

<p>Tap-and-drag in these areas to resize the panels.</p>

<h4 id="transport">Transport</h4>

<p>Record new pattern into timeline, play from beginning, play, play pattern, stop.</p>

<h4 id="octave-up-down">Octave Up/Down</h4>

<p>Change the octave of the touch keyboard.</p>

<h4 id="edit-pattern-indicator">Edit Pattern Indicator</h4>

<p>When locked, you can&rsquo;t make changes to the pattern. </p>

<p><strong>Spacebar</strong> unlocks the world of pattern editing!</p>

<h4 id="volume">Volume</h4>

<p>Tap-and-drag the volume control to change output volume.</p>

<h4 id="menu-items">Menu Items</h4>

<p>Sunvox has one simple menu. Tap here to save and load projects, set preferences like <strong>MIDI controllers</strong>, and the ultra-fun <strong>Touch Theremin</strong> feature! Select it in the Menu, and start making some noise!</p>

<h4 id="switch-to-timeline">Switch To Timeline</h4>

<p>The <strong>Timeline</strong> allows you to place, move, and rearrange patterns to create a song. On PocketC.H.I.P.&rsquo;s small screen, you&rsquo;ll need to use the <strong>Switch To Timeline</strong> button. </p>

<p>In <strong>Timeline</strong>, you can also freely record notes while you play them with the <strong>Record</strong> button, or you can clone patterns to repeat them. Move the patterns blocks around to create your composition. When finished, you can render a finished stereo file and distribute it as you want!</p>

<p><img alt="SunVox timeline view" src="images/sunvox_timeline.jpg" /></p>

<h4 id="midi">MIDI</h4>

<p>You can attach a <strong>MIDI keyboard or controller</strong> to PocketC.H.I.P.&rsquo;s USB port and have even more fun with SunVox. Not only can you play notes from a keyboard, but you can use MIDI knobs and sliders to control parameters of different synths. Tweak on!</p>

<h2 id="terminal">Terminal</h2>

<p><img alt="image of terminal" src="images/no_scale/terminal-icon.png" /></p>

<p>Many may find the <strong>Terminal</strong> archaic or intimidating, it&rsquo;s a place to <strong>type commands directly to the computer</strong> for execution and evaluation by the operating system. There are no icons, just text. </p>

<p>Use the terminal to dive into the operating system’s guts, quickly move files around, play with PocketC.H.I.P.&rsquo;s GPIO, or extend its capabilities. There&rsquo;s a primer on using Terminal in the C.H.I.P. documentation <a href="http://docs.getchip.com/#using-the-terminal">here</a> if you want to learn more.</p>

<h2 id="write">Write</h2>

<p><img alt="image of write" src="images/no_scale/write-icon.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Write is a minimalist text editor</strong> that&rsquo;s well suited for basic text entry tasks. If you&rsquo;re looking to code with Write, you&rsquo;ll be pleased to learn that it supports line numbering and auto indentation, just look under the “Option” menu.</p>

<h2 id="file-browser">File Browser</h2>

<p><img alt="image of file browser" src="images/no_scale/browser-icon.png" /></p>

<p>The <strong>File Browser</strong> provides a <strong>visual representation</strong> of the files on your PocketC.H.I.P. using icons. Drag, drop, and double-click your way through this application for full control over every file on your device.</p>

<h2 id="help">Help</h2>

<p><img alt="image of help icon" src="images/no_scale/help-icon.png" /></p>

<p>You are reading it right now. No kidding! This document is available online and locally on PocketC.H.I.P., which means anywhere PocketC.H.I.P. goes, help will be right there with it.</p>

          <h1 id="settings">Settings</h1>

<p><img alt="settings" src="images/bright.png" /></p>

<p>Use the <strong>PocketC.H.I.P.</strong> settings to change <strong>WiFi</strong>, <strong>screen brightness</strong>, or <strong>volume levels</strong>. </p>

<p><img alt="sproket" src="images/no_scale/settings-icon.jpg" /></p>

<p>To access the <strong>PocketC.H.I.P. settings</strong>, tap on the sprocket icon on the Home Screen.</p>

<h2 id="wifi-amp-bluetooth">WiFi &amp; Bluetooth</h2>

<p><img alt="wifi settings" src="images/wifi-setting.jpg" /></p>

<p>From the Settings Screen, tap the switch next to the WiFi icon to turn WiFi on. </p>

<p>Press the button to the right of the WiFi switch to open a menu of all the networks in range. Scroll through the list by tapping the onscreen arrows, and select your network by tapping on its name.</p>

<p>When prompted, enter the network password in the text field, then touch the <strong>[Connect]</strong> button. It may take a few seconds to connect.</p>

<p>Currently only WiFi is configurable from the PocketC.H.I.P graphical interface. If you want to configure Bluetooth, consult the C.H.I.P. documentation page <a href="http://docs.getchip.com">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="screen-brightness">Screen Brightness</h2>

<p><img alt="brightness" src="images/brightness.jpg" /></p>

<p>Tap the brightness slider on the left to decrease brightness or tap the right to increase. Lowering the brightness is an easy way to increase battery life.</p>

<h2 id="volume">Volume</h2>

<p><img alt="volume" src="images/volume.jpg" /></p>

<p>Adjust the volume slider by tapping on the left to decrease volume or on the right to increase it. Of course, you&rsquo;ll need to have headphones or speakers attached to PocketC.H.I.P. to hear anything.</p>

<h2 id="security">Security</h2>

<p>Just like you have a <strong>username</strong> and <strong>password</strong> for your e-mail account, PocketC.H.I.P. has a username and password for its operating system. The main user account on PocketC.H.I.P. is chip, and the password is also chip. <strong>Both username and password are case sensitive</strong>.</p>

<p>At startup, <strong>PocketC.H.I.P. automatically logs you in as chip</strong>. This means there&rsquo;s no need to manually enter chip’s password chip. There are times when you&rsquo;ll need to use the chip password, but you can get most things done without it.</p>

<p><strong>PocketC.H.I.P. also has a second username called root</strong>, which should only be used for administrative tasks such as installing and removing software. The root password is also chip, and both are also case sensitive.</p>

<p><strong>Never login directly as root</strong>, since it is extremely easy to delete critical files in the system. Instead, use the system administration command <strong>sudo</strong>, which provides a bit of protection from accidentally breaking your system.</p>

<p>For more information on using sudo, see the C.H.I.P. docs <a href="http://docs.getchip.com/#terminal-for-beginners-glossary">here</a>.</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>

<h3 id="changing-your-password">Changing Your Password</h3>

<p><img alt="terminal icon" src="images/no_scale/terminal-icon.png" /></p>

<p><strong>You should change your password</strong> for both the chip and root account to something other than chip. Open the <strong>terminal application</strong> from the PocketC.H.I.P. Home Screen, type the following command:</p>

<p><em>passwd</em></p>

<p>and press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll be prompted for your current password, which is chip and then required to enter in your new password twice. That&rsquo;s it!</p>

          <h1 id="using-accessories">Using Accessories</h1>

<p>Just because <strong>PocketC.H.I.P.</strong> is complete with a keyboard and screen doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t add speakers, storage, or wireless gadgets to make it even more fun. </p>

<p><strong>PocketC.H.I.P. input and output ports are all handled by C.H.I.P.</strong>. Chances are good that if an accessory works with C.H.I.P., it will work with PocketC.H.I.P.!</p>

<p><img alt="Accessory ports" src="images/ports.png" /></p>

<h2 id="audio">Audio</h2>

<p><img alt="Headphones" src="images/headphones.jpg" /></p>

<p><strong>PocketC.H.I.P.</strong> does not have a built-in speaker, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it can&rsquo;t output sound.</p>

<p>To listen to audio from PocketC.H.I.P., <strong>attach any wired headphones or speakers to the audio jack</strong> at the top of the device. This jack is known as a TRRS jack and can accommodate headphones with built-in microphones. </p>

<h2 id="micro-usb">Micro-USB</h2>

<p><img alt="Charging" src="images/wall-power.jpg" /></p>

<p>Use the <strong>micro-USB</strong> port for charging PocketC.H.I.P. with a 5-volt, 1-amp power supply. Most cell phone chargers that use a USB-micro cable will work with PocketC.H.I.P.</p>

<h2 id="standard-usb">Standard USB</h2>

<p><img alt="Webcam" src="images/webcam.jpg" /></p>

<p>Use the <strong>standard USB</strong> port for attaching USB accessories, like a <strong>keyboard</strong>, <strong>mouse</strong>, <strong>MIDI controller</strong>, <strong>sound card</strong>, <strong>hard drive</strong>, or <strong>more</strong>. </p>

<p>USB devices take power to operate. If they are not independently powered, they will reduce the battery life of PocketC.H.I.P. or cause operation to become sporadic.</p>

          <h1 id="faq">FAQ</h1>

<p><strong>Can I take C.H.I.P. out of PocketC.H.I.P. use it?</strong>
At this time, it will not work as expected without reflashing. The C.H.I.P.s in PocketC.H.I.P. run a custom graphics software that&rsquo;s designed for the touchscreen and PocketC.H.I.P. keyboard. C.H.I.P. may boot, but the resolution and input will not work as expected.</p>

<p><strong>Is it Legal to Modify PocketC.H.I.P.?</strong>
Yes. PocketC.H.I.P. and C.H.I.P. are open source hardware. We encourage you to modify PocketC.H.I.P. and be sure to share what you&rsquo;ve done with our community!</p>

<p><strong>Will my microUSB charger work with PocketC.H.I.P.?</strong>
PocketC.H.I.P. is compatible with with most cell phone chargers that use a USB-micro cable. PocketC.H.I.P. needs a power supply capable of outputting 5-volts with at least 1 amp.</p>

<p><strong>Can I connect PocketC.H.I.P. to a second display?</strong>
No. At this time PocketC.H.I.P. does not support multiple displays.</p>

<p><strong>Is it OK to eat PocketC.H.I.P.?</strong> No! Neither C.H.I.P. nor PocketC.H.I.P. should ever be eaten, even by C.H.I.P.py Ruxpin. </p>

<p><strong>Will my Bluetooth Device Work?</strong>
Yes, so long as the device is supported under Debian Linux. However, you will need to setup the bluetooth pairing using the terminal <a href="http://docs.getchip.com/#connecting-bluetooth-devices">here</a>. Our initial release of PocketC.H.I.P. does not provide graphical bluetooth configuration.</p>

<p><strong>Pinch-zooming isn&rsquo;t working, is my screen bad?</strong>
Your screen is fine. The resistive touchscreen used in PocketC.H.I.P. does not support pinch gestures.</p>

<p><strong>How can I get PockulusC.H.I.P.?</strong>
Good news! You already almost have one. All you need to do is 3D print the file at <a href="https://github.com/NextThingCo/PockulusCHIP">here</a> or find a friend to do it for you.</p>

<p>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991</p>

<p>Copyright &copy; 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

<p>Preamble</p>

<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software&ndash;to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation&rsquo;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.</p>

<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>

<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</p>

<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.</p>

<p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.</p>

<p>Also, for each author&rsquo;s protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors&rsquo; reputations.</p>

<p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone&rsquo;s free use or not licensed at all.</p>

<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.</p>

<p>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>

<ol>
<li>This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The &ldquo;Program&rdquo;, below,
refers to any such program or work, and a &ldquo;work based on the Program&rdquo;
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term &ldquo;modification&rdquo;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>

<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</p>

<ol>
<li>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&rsquo;s
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.</li>
</ol>

<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>

<p>a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>

<p>b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.</p>

<p>c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>

<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.</p>

<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p>

<p>a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>

<p>b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>

<p>c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.</p>

<p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.</p></li>
<li><p>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.</p></li>
<li><p>Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients&rsquo; exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.</p></li>
<li><p>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.</p>

<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.</p>

<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p></li>
<li><p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &ldquo;any
later version&rdquo;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>

<p>NO WARRANTY</p></li>
<li><p>BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p></li>
<li><p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

<p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>

<p>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>

<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the &ldquo;copyright&rdquo; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>

<p><one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright &copy; <year>  <name of author></p>

<p>This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.</p>

<p>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.</p>

<p>You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.</p>

<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>

<p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:</p>

<p>Gnomovision version 69, Copyright &copy; year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type <code class="prettyprint">show w&#39;.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type</code>show c&rsquo; for details.</p>

<p>The hypothetical commands <code class="prettyprint">show w&#39; and</code>show c&rsquo; should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than <code class="prettyprint">show w&#39; and</code>show c&rsquo;; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items&ndash;whatever suits your program.</p>

<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a &ldquo;copyright disclaimer&rdquo; for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:</p>

<p>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision&rsquo; (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.</p>

<p><signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice</p>

<p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.</p>
